It's not that I don't want to, it's just that I wouldn't know what to make of two
calls - e.g. if a handler pipeline has a handler from each of the calls, how would
these two handlers be ordered?

Please remember that this is just RearrangeHandlersPipelineInspector talking - i.e.
only ONE possible implementation of IInspectHandlerPipeline - so if you feel that
there's something that I don't express clearly enough, or otherwise can't fulfill
your needs, please feel free to implement something more expressive yourself.

Oh, btw. - if you're in doubt as to where the first call to SetOrder happened, here's
the stacktrace:
