# First Exercise Revisited

Repeat the first exercise, but try to incorporate the things you've learned in the previous exercises. Below you'll find a list of the shortcuts that might be helpful for faster flows.

## Problem

Start in the `ReSharperWorkshop` project. Create the 2 following classes:

* `Plan`
* `Document`

The `Plan` class should take a name (`string`), some documents (`IEnumerable<Document>`) and a security classification (`Basic.Support.SecurityClassification`) in it's constructor and expose them as read-only properties.
