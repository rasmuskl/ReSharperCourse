    /// The purpose of this class is so there's one core way of downloading remote files with urls that are from
    /// outside users. There's various areas in BlogEngine where an attacker could supply an external url to the server
    /// and tie up resources.
    /// 
    /// For example, the JavascriptHandler accepts off-server addresses as a path. An attacker could, for instance, pass the url
    /// to a file that's a few gigs in size, causing the server to get out-of-memory exceptions or some other errors. An attacker
    /// could also use this same method to use one BlogEngine instance to hammer another site by, again, passing an off-server
    /// address of the victims site to the JavascriptHandler. 
    /// 
    /// RemoteFile makes use of two BlogSettings properties: AllowServerToDownloadRemoteFiles and RemoteFileDownloadTimeout.
    /// 
    /// This class will not throw an exception if the Uri supplied points to a resource local to the running BlogEngine instance.
    /// 
    /// There shouldn't be any security issues there, as the internal WebRequest instance is still calling it remotely. 
    /// Any local files that shouldn't be accessed by this won't be allowed by the remote call.
